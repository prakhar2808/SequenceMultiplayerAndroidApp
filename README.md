# SequenceMultiplayerAndroidApp

Android Application for the board game "Sequence", that can be played in online multiplayer mode with 2 or 3 people.

The App uses no server and only relies on Firebase and EventListeners - kind of like P2P with the hosts updating their statuses in the databases, rather than conveying directly to others.
